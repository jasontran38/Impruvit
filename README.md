# Impruvit

Impruvit is a habit tracking game where you can bet on yourself completing a series of self-improvement challenges. You get 250 points initially, and everyday, the game will offer you a challenge. For example, one day you might get a challenge like "We bet 50 points that you won't go to the gym today". You will lose 50 points from your wallet. If you upload proof of yourself at the gym by midnight, you then get 100 points back. 

The features in the initial version include:

- Ability to create and track one habit 
- Ability to upload media to prove you completed a habit for the day

This should be done by the 28/03/2021
